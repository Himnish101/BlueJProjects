Issues

1) Understanding the code and what each code is supposed

2) I didn't understand object-oriented programming in BlueJ as much as other apps - I did an external course on BlueJ so I can understand better

3) I had plenty of issues when programming what happens when the players use particular objects in the game

4) I had left it super late so I had to quicker than wanted

5) I had a problem at first using the commands in the game
